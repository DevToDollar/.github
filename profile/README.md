## Hi there

DevToDollars is a tech cofounder as a service platform

## A bit about the organization
The original creator of the devtodollars boilerplate is Matthew Wong.

He is a former YC founder. Throughout his journey, he went from $0 - $10k of revenue 2 separate times and before his third time he wanted to create a startup template for building apps (Flutter / Supabase) to expedite this process.

Matthew currently holds an advisory role at devtodollars.

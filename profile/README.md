## Hi there, I'm Matt 👋

DevToDollar is a template for creating mobile app startups. I help you reach your first $10k of revenue.

## A bit about me

I'm a former YC founder and because of some circumstances, I'm now starting from zero again. Throughout my journey, I went from $0 - $10k of revenue 2 separate times and before my third time I want to create a startup template for building apps (Flutter / Supabase) to expedite this process.
